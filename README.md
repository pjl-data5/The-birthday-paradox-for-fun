# The-birthday-paradox-for-fun
This is more of a couneter intutive thought experiment than an actual paradox in the true sense of the word (to be completely technical).

However, this is the sort of question any statistician/data scientist will evetually be asked: 
What is the probability that 2 people or more in a group share the same birthday? Its larger than you think. In fact, its more than 50% for group larger than aroun 20 people.
