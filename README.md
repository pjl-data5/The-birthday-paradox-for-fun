# The-birthday-paradox-for-fun
This is more of a counter intutive thought experiment than an actual paradox in the true sense of the word (to be completely technical). The more people you look at, the higher the chances are of finding a pair of similar birthdays.

However, this is the sort of question any statistician/data scientist will evetually be asked: 
What is the probability that 2 people or more in a group share the same birthday? Its larger than you think. In fact, its more than 50% for group larger than aroun 20 people.
